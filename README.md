# Abstract:
This document describes HTHP, a protocol for controlling, ~~raping~~, and communicating with homos.      
# 1.Rationale and Scope:
All humans are homo (inappropriate).
Thus, there is a deep♂️, dark♂️, rich requirement for a protocol designed for homos.      
This document specifies a Hyper Text Homo Protocol (HTHP), which permits the full request and responses necessary to contact all homos.      
Future versions of this protocol may include extensions for more memes.      
# 2.HTHP Protocol:
## 2.1 HTHP Server:
HTHP service will always use the port 1145 ~~(or anal)~~. Other ports are not allowed.
HTHP Server must be controlled by a homo.      
## 2.2 HTHP return codes:
```
24 I am a student
114 Accepted
514 Continue
1919 Gone
810 I am a monster
404 I'm not a homo
364 Let me see see
416 I'm a xyn
```
# 3.The "homo" URI scheme:
```
homo-url  =  "homo" ":" [ "//" host ]
                ["/" anal ] ["?" additions-list ]
```
